//! ALL HAIL THE HOLY BAGUETTE
//!
//! This crate is intentionally empty. One cannot select features of
//! non-top-level crates with `-p` or `--all`, so the crate containing
//! the tests is the top-level one instead, and both `cargo test --all`
//! and `cargo test --all --features std` work as expected.
